# Tutorial Labs

This website acts as a repository for tutorials and guide I may write on different
subjects that haven't goes through the rigorous process of instructional
design, testing and correction to become official tutorial onf the [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/)
website yet. Instead of them siting somewhere unseen, they may still help
someone learn something new, so they are offered rough here (as in no one proof read
my terrible english nor tested them to make them more streamlined)

Those tutorials are all text tutorial (with accompanying images), and vary in
levels, from sample of "how to x" for beginners to simple guide that help reading
code from more complex project aimed at intermediate programmers.
